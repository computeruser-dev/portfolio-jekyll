	Software Engineer and Game Developer.

	I develop tools, games, and software, often related to climate solutions and sustainabilty. Talk to me about climate games!
</p>
<p>
	I'm especially interested in developing internal tools and underlying simulation systems, and in designing games and interactive software that leaves players with new ways of thinking about science and the environment.
