	Hi, I'm Jaden, a software engineer and game developer. 
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy designing and developing tools, architecture, and simulation systems.
</p>
<p>
	I'm particularly interested in working on climate solutions and sustainability.
	I develop games and interactive software designed to leave players with new ways of thinking about science and the environment.
	Talk to me about climate games!
