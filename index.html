<p>
	Hi, I'm Jaden, a software engineer and game developer. I build tools that make your life easier and experiences that change the way you think.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoy designing and developing tools, architecture, and simulation systems. 
	<br>
	I'm particularly interested in working on climate solutions and sustainability.
	<br>
	Talk to me about climate games!
